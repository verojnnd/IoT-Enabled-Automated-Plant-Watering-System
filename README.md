This 1-week project develops an automated plant watering system using ESP8266 technology for monitoring soil moisture across five different crop types: 
üå∂Ô∏è Chili Peppers 
üåΩ Corn
üçâ Watermelon
üåø Grass
üßÖ Onions

The system uses a 1.3" OLED display to provide user interface and crop selection, allowing precise monitoring of soil conditions. Through pushbutton controls, users can select a specific crop and view its moisture levels in real-time. The device connects to a Blynk IoT dashboard, enabling remote monitoring and automated irrigation. When soil moisture falls below a crop-specific threshold, a mini submersible pump activates to water the plants, ensuring optimal growing conditions. A reset button allows easy switching between different crop types. Powered by a rechargeable VTC6 battery for ESP8266 and a 9V battery for the pump, the system offers a practical solution for maintaining consistent plant care with minimal manual intervention.

Components used:
- Amica LUA V2 ESP8266
- 1.3" OLED Display (128x64 pixel)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 5V Mini Submersible Pump
- Single-channel Relay
- Rechargeable VTC6 Battery
- 6 Pushbuttons (5 for crop selection, 1 for reset)
- 9V Battery
